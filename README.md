# Psyche Sampling Simulation

This project was made for the Spring 2025 capstone project session by Aria Harley, Allison Flatt, Jared Smithbauer, and Mathias Nebiyou.

Our sponsor was the Arizona State University in collaboration with NASA for the Psyche project.

Thank you to our ASU sponsor Cassie Bowman, our advisor Shahid Hussain, and all of our other professors at Penn State Behrend for making this possible.
